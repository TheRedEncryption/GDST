      <h3>What is this website?</h3>
      <p>TheRedEncryption's Geometry Dash Save Toolbox is the GD community's one stop shop for all their saving needs!
        You can do tons of cool things here, like decrypting your save file or importing images (like vector graphics
        and
        pixel art) into your levels!
        Simply start by uploading CCLocalLevels.dat and then choosing a tool to use.
        After that, you can download the modified file and place it back into your saves.</p>

      <h3>Where are my files?</h3>
      <p>Your saves are located in <u><i>C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\GeometryDash</i></u> where you can find
        CCLocalLevels.dat.
        (make sure you do not confuse this with the other .dat files there!)</p>

      <h3>How does this website work?</h3>
      <p>All code is written in Javascript, which is executed by your very own browser.
        A lot of the code is written by myself, but not all of it.</p>

      Did you know? A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into this. Visit

          my GitHub page,</a>
        where all the files are located. You can even see if there are any secrets within the files in the form of
        comments!
        <!-- hee hee, this is one such secret -->
        Although, you might not want to if you want to keep your sanity.
