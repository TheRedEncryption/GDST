# GDST
## What does this do?
(for now) You can convert an image into Geometry Dash objects!
## Why do I want this?
- You can have an easier time making pixel art
- You can draft a level much faster
- Because why not?
## How do I use this?
[Click here to access the best Geometry Dash Save Toolbox of all time (well technically the only one, but still!)](https://theredencryption.github.io/GDST/)
## Thanks to:
- [pako.js](https://nodeca.github.io/pako/) (I used it unmodified)
- The internet
- Robtop (he made Geometry Dash)
## Upcoming features I will add (eventually i hope):
- SVG support
- Level generator at a click of a button (haven't fully decided yet if i want it to be AI or algorithmically driven)
## Thanks for using TheRedEncryption's Geometry Dash Save Toolbox!
